## BUSINESS UNDERSTANDING
### Project Overview
This project is designed to help a company manage it`s fleet effectively. The project is developed with the transport department of the said comapny in mind. The comapny has several vehicles that are being managed by the transport department. For the smooth running of the company processes, every department needs to work optimally, transport department included. The project aims at making sure the fleets are utilised in a manner that serves their purpose effectively.

### Problem Statement 
The comapny having a huge fleet, makes it hard to handle and manage them cassually. There needs to be a system that helps to manage the same. The project at hand aims to adress some of the challenges that the department could otherwise face on fleet management. The project aims to do the following. 
1.  Monitor Fuel, maintainance and Insurance expenses for the fleets. This helps us to determine the units that are prooving expensive  to own
2.  Monitor fuel effieciency, Vehicle downtime and maintainace frequencies. This is critical for pinpointing units that are less efficient.
3.  Assess the quality of maintaince products from different suppliers. Spare parts of good quality are more durable and therefore we aim to identify which suppliers and parts are to be ordered.
